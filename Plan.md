Daily Practice Tips

Split time 50/50: 1h learning/concept, 1h hands-on coding

Maintain a journal of learnings, errors, and solutions

Push code to GitHub daily or weekly to track progress

Refactor older projects using new learnings from each phase

Record short screencasts for animations or UI experiments
