## **Advanced Topics to Practice**

### 1. Networking
- GraphQL with Apollo client
- WebSockets for real-time apps
- Combine networking pipelines
- Retry, caching, and pagination handling

### 2. Concurrency
- `async/await` in real-world APIs
- Task groups & structured concurrency
- Actor isolation & thread safety

### 3. Architecture & Design Patterns
- MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel + Coordinator)
- VIPER module creation
- Clean Swift / Modular architecture

### 4. Animations & UI
- SwiftUI matched geometry effect
- Custom UIKit transitions
- Gesture-driven interactions

### 5. Persistence & Database
- CoreData with relationships & batch operations
- Realm with sync and encryption

### 6. Testing & CI
- Dependency injection for unit testing
- Mock APIs
- XCTest + UI automation

### 7. Security
- Keychain storage
- Biometric authentication (FaceID / TouchID)
- Secure API token handling

### 8. Performance
- Instruments profiling (CPU, memory)
- Detecting retain cycles / memory leaks
- Optimizing TableViews / SwiftUI Lists
